# Tic Tac Toe on Rails

I created this app during week 5 of my web development bootcamp at General Assembly. It was my first time working on the same code base for a week. I created a Rails app with a Devise user log in, user profiles, a Tic Tac Toe game and a leaderboard. 

Users can play against each other or against the computer.

I also implemented the Acts-as-commentable gem for user profile and the Ransack gem to sort the leaderboard by user names.

## Technology used

Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS. I didn't know JavaScript when I created this in November 2014, so users can only see updates when the refresh the page.

## How to run it
  `cd tictactoe`

  `bundle install`

  `rails s`
  
 `open http://localhost:8888`
